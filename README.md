# Project Overview and Goals

## Introduction
The University of Chicago’s Mind Bytes Data Visualization Challenge offers an opportunity to showcase data visualization skills by uncovering insights within complex data. This project examines the relationship between youth gun-related deaths and academic achievement, specifically four-year high school graduation rates. By visualizing this connection, we aim to highlight potential patterns and spark conversations about the broader social factors influencing student outcomes.

## Motivation
Gun violence has been a longstanding issue in the Chicagoland area, impacting communities and shaping the experiences of young people. In 2024 alone, there were _______ youth (ages 0-17) gun-related deaths in the Chicago area. For this challenge, we sought to explore the question: *“How are academic achievement and gun violence related?”* To investigate this, we analyzed the relationship between four-year graduation rates and gun-related deaths for youth ages 0-17 by zip code in the Chicago area.
